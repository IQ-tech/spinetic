## The Spinetic Playground

Welcome to the Spinetic playground! Here, you can test the properties of your carousel and, at the end, export the settings you've tried out. It's all about customizing your carousel.

<Primary />

These are all the properties that you can pass to <strong>Spinetic</strong>. Modify them and see how it looks. In the end, go to <strong>Show Code</strong> and copy the props.

<Controls />

## Stories - Examples

Here are some examples of configurations. Try expanding them or see if any examples suit your specific case.

<Stories title="" />
